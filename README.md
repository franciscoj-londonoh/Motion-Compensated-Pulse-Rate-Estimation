# Motion compensated pulse rate estimation

## Project Overview
This project was part of the path to finish UdacityÂ´s nanodegree: "AI for Healthcare", in which skills acquired in the "Applying AI to Wearable Device Data" course were applied to build a pulse rate estimation algorithm for a wrist-wearable device. A core feature that many users expect from their wearable devices is pulse rate estimation. Continuous pulse rate estimation can be informative for many aspects of a wearer's health. Pulse rate during exercise can be a measure of workout intensity and resting heart rate is sometimes used as an overall measure of cardiovascular fitness. 

## Background

Pulse rate is typically estimated by using a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor. When the ventricles contract, the capillaries in the wrist fill with blood. The (typically green) light emitted by the PPG sensor is absorbed by red blood cells in these capillaries and the photodetector will see the drop in reflected light. When the blood returns to the heart, fewer red blood cells in the wrist absorb the light and the photodetector sees an increase in reflected light. The period of this oscillating waveform is the pulse rate.
However, the heart beating is not the only phenomenon that modulates the PPG signal. Blood in the wrist is fluid, and arm movement will cause the blood to move correspondingly. During exercise, like walking or running, we see another periodic signal in the PPG due to this arm motion. Our pulse rate estimator has to be careful not to confuse this periodic signal with the pulse rate.

We can use the accelerometer signal of our wearable device to help us keep track of which periodic signal is caused by motion. Because the accelerometer is only sensing arm motion, any periodic signal in the accelerometer is likely not due to the heart beating, and only due to the arm motion. If our pulse rate estimator is picking a frequency that's strong in the accelerometer, it may be making a mistake.

All estimators will have some amount of error. How much error is tolerable depends on the application. If we were using these pulse rate estimates to compute long term trends over months, then we may be more robust to higher error variance. However, if we wanted to give information back to the user about a specific workout or night of sleep, we would require a much lower error.

Algorithm Confidence and Availability
Many machine learning algorithms produce outputs that can be used to estimate their per-result error. For example, in logistic regression, you can use the predicted class probabilities to quantify trust in the classification. A classification where one class has a very high probability is probably more accurate than one where all classes have similar probabilities. Certainly, this method is not perfect and won't perfectly rank-order estimates based on error. But if accurate enough, it allows consumers of the algorithm more flexibility in how to use it. We call this estimation of the algorithm's error the confidence.

In pulse rate estimation, having a confidence value can be useful if a user wants just a handful of high-quality pulse rate estimate per night. They can use the confidence algorithm to select the 20 most confident estimates at night and ignore the rest of the outputs. Confidence estimates can also be used to set the point on the error curve that we want to operate at by sacrificing the number of estimates that are considered valid. There is a trade-off between availability and error. For example, if we want to operate at 10% availability, we look at our training dataset to determine the confidence threshold for which 10% of the estimates pass. Then if only if an estimate's confidence value is above that threshold, do we consider it valid. See the error vs. availability curve below.

This plot is created by computing the mean absolute error at all -- or at least 100 of -- the confidence thresholds in the dataset.

Building a confidence algorithm for pulse rate estimation is a little tricker than logistic regression because intuitively, there isn't some transformation of the algorithm output that can make a good confidence score. However, by understanding our algorithm behavior, we can come up with some general ideas that might create a good confidence algorithm. For example, if our algorithm is picking a strong frequency component that's not present in the accelerometer, we can be relatively confident in the estimate. Turn this idea into an algorithm by quantifying "strong frequency component".

## Project Highlight
The development of this project resulted in an algorithm that:
* Estimates pulse rate from the PPG signal and a 3-axis accelerometer
* Assumes pulse rate will be restricted between 40BPM (beats per minute) and 240BPM
* Produces an estimation confidence. A higher confidence value means that this estimate should be more accurate than an estimate with a lower confidence value
* Produces an output at least every 2 seconds



## The Project at a glance
This project has 2 main parts.
> 1. Develop a Pulse Rate Algorithm on the given training data. Then Test Your Algorithm and see that it has met the success criteria.
> 2. Apply the Pulse Rate Algorithm on a Clinical Application and compute more clinically meaningful features and discover healthcare trends.

Success criteria
The algorithm performance success criteria was if the mean absolute error (MAE) at 90% availability was less than 15 BPM on the test set. Put another way, the best 90% of the estimates, according to the confidence output, must have a MAE of less than 15 BPM.


Remember to bandpass filter all your signals. Use the 40-240BPM range to create your pass band.
Use plt.specgram to visualize your signals in the frequency domain. You can plot your estimates on top of the spectrogram to see where things are going wrong.
When the dominant accelerometer frequency is the same as the PPG, try picking the next strongest PPG frequency if there is another good candidate.
Sometimes the cadence of the arm swing is the same as the heartbeat. So if you can't find another good candidate pulse rate outside of the accelerometer peak, it may be the same as the accelerometer.
One option for a confidence algorithm is to answer the question, "How much energy in the frequency spectrum is concentrated near the pulse rate estimate?" You can answer this by summing the frequency spectrum near the pulse rate estimate and dividing it by the sum of the entire spectrum.

Dataset
You will be using the [Troika](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6905737) dataset to build your algorithm. Find the dataset under datasets/troika/training_data. The README in that folder will tell you how to interpret the data. The starter code contains a function to help load these files.
