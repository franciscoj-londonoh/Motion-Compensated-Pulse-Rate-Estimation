# Motion-Compensated-Pulse-Rate-Estimation

## Overview
This project has 2 main parts.

> 1. Develop a Pulse Rate Algorithm on the given training data. Then Test Your Algorithm and see that it has met the success criteria.
> 2. Apply the Pulse Rate Algorithm on a Clinical Application and compute more clinically meaningful features and discover healthcare trends.

## Introduction
A core feature that many users expect from their wearable devices is pulse rate estimation. Continuous pulse rate estimation can be informative for many aspects of a wearer's 
health. Pulse rate during exercise can be a measure of workout intensity and resting heart rate is sometimes used as an overall measure of cardiovascular fitness. 
In this project, a pulse rate estimation algorithm was built for a wrist-wearable device.
